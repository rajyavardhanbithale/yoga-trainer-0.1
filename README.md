 ## About The Project

![Screenshort](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajyavardhanbithale/yoga-trainer/main/images/preview/proto2.png)


**Welcome** to my project! I'am developed a platform using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for **deep learning-based yoga guidance**.

Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TensorFlow.js, it's user-friendly and continuously evolving with an expanding selection of poses."

- Seamlessly **select and perform** yoga poses
- Receive **real-time feedback** on pose accuracy
- Benefit from helpful tips and insights from our **narrator**
- Utilize our **intuitive interface** and seamless integration for a smooth user experience
